## Thank you chadbaldwin

I was looking for a quick way to host some notes to myself that I know I'll end up having to solve again. Thats when I stumbled on [a blog post](https://chadbaldwin.net/2021/03/14/how-to-build-a-sql-blog.html) from [chadbaldwin](https://github.com/chadbaldwin) where he provided a quickstart template and directions to use Github pages. If you need a quick solution with low maintainance and zero cost you can't beat it.

Highly recommend you check it out.
